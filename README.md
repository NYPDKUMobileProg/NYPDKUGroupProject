Issues to consider -

Issues 02: Ideate for Android application, what type of application, service or product is to be created and more specific functions.

Issues 03: Create UML class diagram for possible objects, functions and structure of the application itself.

Issues 04: Design a UI with UX specifics, desire a clean, simplistic but intuitive interface. Usage of metaphors preferred for icons.

Potential issues: Research on web service creation, Ruby on RAILS or Google services and linking to android client. Research on alternatives, various services and competitors, how to differentiate our service or product.
